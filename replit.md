# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React and TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. The UI leverages Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a cohesive casino-themed design system. State management is handled through Zustand stores for game state, audio controls, and authentication. The application includes Three.js integration for potential 3D visual effects and immersive gaming elements.

## Backend Architecture
The server uses Express.js with Socket.io for real-time multiplayer functionality. Game logic is centralized in a GameManager class that handles room management, synchronized countdowns, and betting mechanics. Session-based authentication is implemented with role-based access control (user/admin). The architecture separates concerns between HTTP routes for authentication/data access and WebSocket events for real-time game interactions.

## Database Design
PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM handles data persistence. The schema includes users for authentication, players for game-specific data (chips, stats), games for match history, bets for wagering records, and chat messages for in-game communication. The design supports tracking bet outcomes, player statistics, and complete game audit trails.

## Real-time Communication
Socket.io manages all real-time features including room joining/leaving, synchronized countdowns, simultaneous card reveals, and live chat. Events are structured to maintain game state consistency across all connected clients, ensuring fair gameplay and synchronized experiences.

## Authentication & Authorization
Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing provides secure user management. The system supports both regular users and admin roles, with middleware protecting sensitive routes and admin functionality like user management dashboards.

## Audio System
Custom audio management with support for background music, sound effects (card reveals, countdowns, betting actions), and user-controlled muting. Audio files are handled as Vite assets with proper loading and playback controls.
